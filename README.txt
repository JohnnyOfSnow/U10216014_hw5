Information:

  The homework require me to write a program that simulate a calculator.
  Then, the calculator should have password that user must enter to use calculator.
  
How I design the calculator:
  I design a calculator that have + , - , * ,and /.
  However, I choose to spend more time on how to let user set password.
  First time you use the calculator you have to set a password. After a password had
  existed, the program require user to enter password.
