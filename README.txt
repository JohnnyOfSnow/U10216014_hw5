Information:

  The homework require me to write a program that simulate a calculator.
  Then, the calculator should have password that user must enter to use calculator.
  
How I design the calculator:
  I design a calculator that have + , - , * ,and /.
  However, I choose to spend more time on how to let user set password.
  As the homework require, user first time use the calculator must enter the initial
  password(0000). When the password enter, I require user set a password, or he/she 
  can't use calculator.Refer to the CH14 file class in textbook, I write reading 
  file and writing file program segment.Second time, when user open the jar file 
  , it search the password.txt file in current directory.Actually, the password is 
  based on the file, you need to enter the password which password.txt has.
